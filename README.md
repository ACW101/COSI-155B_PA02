# COSI-155B_PA02

Due Wednesday 3/13/18 before midnight

You are to work with your team to modify the game0 demo from class and make the following changes:

- [x] Add key controls Q and E to rotate the avatar camera view to the left and right, respectively\
    Look at how we move the avatar camera forward and backward and up and down with arrow keys

- [x] Replace the box avatar with a Monkey avatar (but still use the Physijs.BoxMesh container for the Physics)\
See L11 about Loading objects

- [x] Create a NonPlayableCharacter which moves toward the avatar if the avatar gets too close (e.g. 20 meters away)\
You can use the lookAt method to have the NPC face the avatar

- [x] When the NPC hits the Avatar, the avatar should lose a point of health and the NPC should be teleported to a random position on the board\
see how we teleported the avatar with the "h" key

- [ ] When the Avatar reaches zero health, the game should go to a You Lose scene, which the player can restart with the "r" key\
look at how we handle the "win" situation

- [x] Add a start screen, where the user can initiate play by hitting the P key

- Each member of the team should also add at least one additional feature to the game
